This project is a simple PHP code test designed to preview your basic coding style and
approach. Within the Questions.php file contains a class named "Questions".
each public method of this class is a problem for you to solve, with the problem
description in the docblock of the method.  Fill each function with the code
necessary to return the expected results from the problem description.


-- Optional:  Use PHPUnit to verify solutions --

Each test problem is also coupled with a PHPUnit test which will verify the
solution you've created.  These tests will be used against your submitted
solutions to test them (with the exception of the bonus question).  

The project has been setup so that the phpunit command can be run in the root,
and correctly run all tests.

These tests are located in tests/QuestionsTest.php. If your
solution is correct, all tests should pass.  The tests themselves are complete
and do not need any modification.  If you would like to use these tests to
verify your solution before submitting them, you will need to setup PHPUnit.
This is not part of the test and is completely optional -- the tests are just
provided for your convenience.
